## Common Banking and Finance Terminologies
### - Customer Identification Number (CIN)
      A CIN (Customer Identification Number), also known as CIN ID, is an X- length alphanumeric unique 
      identifier used by banks to identify customers and store their personal information.
### - Account Number
      A bank account number is a unique set of digits assigned to the account when you open a bank account.
      Financial institutions will assign such numbers to each account you hold. Businesses and banks use these numbers to identify your account.
### - Account Opening Date
      The account opening date is the date on which the account has been made active and it means that the account opened in the system
      is connected to the bank server. It may be after one day or two days in the case of intervening holiday if any.
### - Account Close Date
      A closing date is when your billing cycle ends and a new “statement period” begins. Again, the bank will also account for any
      interest from hanging balances on your closing date.
### - Account Opening Balance
      An opening balance is the amount in an account at the start of an accounting period. 
### - Account Closing Balance
      In banking, the closing balance simply refers to the bank balance at the end of a day, month, or year. This includes both credit and debit amounts.
